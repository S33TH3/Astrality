# Installing (READ THIS AND FOLLOW IT STEP BY STEP BEFORE ASKING QUESTIONS)
1. setup the create: astral modpack which can be found here: https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/create-astral
(you can also install it via my favorite launcher: GDLauncher, by just searching it up inside the launcher - https://gdlauncher.com)

2. download astrality from google drive: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1upYSQmTnj6TNsr20raYcT87oJ2oGQ7af?usp=share_link

3. go to your create: astral modpack files
(can be found in gdlauncher by right clicking the modpack and clicking open folder)

4. drag the mods from our google drive into the create: astral mods folder
