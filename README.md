1. setup the create: astral modpack which can be found here: https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/create-astral

2. download astrality from google drive: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1upYSQmTnj6TNsr20raYcT87oJ2oGQ7af?usp=share_link

(can be found in gdlauncher by right clicking the modpack and clicking open folder)

3. replace the mods folder with the folder from the repo
